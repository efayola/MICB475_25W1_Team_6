# MICB475_25W1_Team_6
This project and study wanted to determine whether host sex influenced microbial diversity in calves on top of changes driven by age. Our analyses also observed the shift in microbial composition and diversity of the calves.

## Scripts, codes, and figures
[QIIME2](QIIME2) processing was done on fecal microbiome [16s RNA sequencing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP520455&f=env_broad_scale_sam_ss%3An%3Benv_local_scale_sam_ss%3An&o=acc_s%3Aa#) data from [Kim et al., 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04677-7).

  
Subsequent downstream analyses including alpha- and beta-diversity metrics, core microbiome analysis, and differential abundance were conducted on [R](R_project).
