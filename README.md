## Lab Notebook

[QIIME2](QIIME2) processing was done on fecal microbiome [16s RNA sequencing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP520455&f=env_broad_scale_sam_ss%3An%3Benv_local_scale_sam_ss%3An&o=acc_s%3Aa#) data from [Kim et al., 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04677-7).

  
Subsequent downstream analyses including alpha- and beta-diversity metrics, core microbiome analysis, and differential abundance were conducted on [R](R_project).
