## Agenda
* did taxonomy-based filtering, but should we do metadata-based filtering as well?
  * T1-T5 pre-weaning | T6-T8 post-weaning, Female | Male
  * or T1-T8, since we're excluding T9
* check frequency per sample max freuquency when generating rarefaction curve
* check sampling depth: 49216 - 49303
