## Agenda
* We decided to choose this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04677-7) by Kim et al., 2025
* Link to the [reads](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP520455&f=env_broad_scale_sam_ss%3An%3Benv_local_scale_sam_ss%3An&o=acc_s%3Aa#)
  

## Notes
Gut microbiome diversity at different time points of calf development - just fecal samples
  * before and after weening 
  * omit T9
  * pre- and post- weening 


read review paper: microbiome first 1000 days (longitudinal analyses)
  * see how they structure figures 
  * i.e.
  * expect linear changes over time, replicates for each calves
  * first 1000 days may be chaotic :(

  
* keep copy of original metadata, upload all files as you go along to the github repo
* can start processing after metadata is formatted

### Pens and sharks and things 


## Goals for next time
* for the future: email the data publishers? for paper publishing in a bigger journal?
* re-train classifier (with detached screen)
* process data in team 6 shared server
