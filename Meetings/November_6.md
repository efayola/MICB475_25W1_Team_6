## Agenda
* discuss sampling depth and tree file (phylogeny objects)
* Going forward with R studio
  * could we do a heat map instead of bar plot for the diversity metric
  * should we re-do alpha rarefaction curve on r studio for better visualization
  * pcoa analysis: should we do weighted or unweighted uniFrac, or bray-kurtis 

## Notes
* start running our analyses on R asap - we only have ~3 meetings left, Evelyn will be joining in the last meetings to see our progress
* we propose 1 figure for each of our aim
* Aim: control using the diets of the calves bcs research shows that there are similar data visualization - see if there's any correlation between the diet and the fecal microbiome
  *  if we want to do this, create a different figure panel of the diet and another for the actual calves

* maybe we could do core microbiome: overlap between maternal milk and T1-T4 or pellet and T5-T8
  *  points of consideration: T5 (calves eating pellet and milk), T1 (just milk), T7 (just pellet)
  *  heat map in addition to the core microbiome analysis is a yes - need to get started early though
 
 *  pcoa analysis: ritu will check in on it 
 
* **breaking up work**
  * Split up running the codes in R
  * someone do revisions next week
