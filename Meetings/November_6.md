## Agenda
* discuss sampling depth and tree file (phylogeny objects)
* Going forward with R studio
  * could we do a heat map instead of bar plot for the diversity metric
  * should wew re-do alpha rarefaction curve on r studio for better visualization

## Notes
* start running our analyses on R asap - we only have ~3 meetings left, Evelyn will be joining in the last meetings to see our progress
* we propose 1 figure for each of our aim
* Aim: control using the diets of the calves bcs research shows that there are similar data visualization - see if there's any correlation between the diet and the fecal microbiome
  *  if we want to do this, create a different figure panel of the diet and another for the actual calves
* maybe we could do core microbiome: overlap between maternal milk and T1-T4 or pellet and T5-T8
