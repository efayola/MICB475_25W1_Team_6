### Agenda
- discuss putting together manuscript
- finalize which figures to include (using T1, T6, T8 as main timepoints instead of T1, T5, T8)
    - do we add  T1, T5, T8 figures we've made into supplementary or will that be too much?
- what to add in supplementary (T5/T6 and T7/T8 comparisions?)
