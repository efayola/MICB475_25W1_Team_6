### Agenda
- discuss putting together manuscript
- finalize which figures to include (using T1, T6, T8 as main timepoints instead of T1, T5, T8)
    - do we add  T1, T5, T8 figures we've made into supplementary or will that be too much?
- what to add in supplementary (T5/T6 and T7/T8 comparisions?)


### Notes
for manuscript:
- make sure to add references for everything (tools, QIIME, R packages, etc.)
- results section: titles should convey our main findings in one sentence, in bold
- include p values in figure legend, not in text body (Results)
- add comparisons between T5/T6 and T7/T8 in supplementary section
- tax glom core microbiome? email Evelyn and Avril to clarify if we need to do this
    - tax glom at genus level. More robust statistically than ASVs.  
- can keep taxa bar plot at Phylum level
- draft manuscript is due Dec 14 11:59PM
