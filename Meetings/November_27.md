## Agenda 
- review alpha and beta diversity results
- review DESeq results
- review core microbiome results
- discuss preparing for oral presentation

## Notes
- no need for heat map as it does not add much to our story, create 10 top overrepresented taxa bar plot instead 
- need to change colours on venn diagrams so that the numbers are easier to read
