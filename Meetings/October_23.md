## Agenda
* discuss how to write a research paper
* tips for our paper specifically?

## Notes
**For proposal**

* look for any paper that predicts for differences in weening 
* we plan to answer these questions for these datasets - dont put a lot of details on the dataset in the intro themselves (there is dataset overview)
* keep it formal  - dont use phrases commonly used when we're conversing
  
<br>  

**Others**
  
* mention which diversity metric is being used 
* refer to statistical metrics used in references
* link everything to question, dont mention irrelevant things
  
<br>

**Hypothesis**
  
  * mention why or what you think may be the difference. this particular bacteria will be more after weening. mention why we will see differences and why will we see those difference.

**References**
  * cite qiime as a tool and packages used
