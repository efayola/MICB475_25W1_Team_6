## Agenda
- review choice for sequencing depth
- review alpha diversity results
- review beta diversity results
- review taxonomy results
- review core microbiome results
- guidance for network analysis

## Notes
Fig.1
- panel A = calf gg richness timepoints sex no overlap (no stats) 
  - p-value in table supplemental significance compare it to T1
- panel B = beta diversity pcoa based on sex
- panel C = beta diversity pcoa based on timepoint (acknowledge its the same plot as B coloured by diff metadata in the figure legend)
